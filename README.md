<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Omid Daliri</h1>

I'm 22 years old and passionate about programming, designing, and developing web pages. I'm proficient in HTML and CSS, and currently learning JavaScript and React. I also have extensive experience with WordPress and have developed several e-commerce websites using this platform.

At present, I work as the IT Team Manager at 'Moshrefi Holding' where I've been honing my skills for over two years. Additionally, I have a solid understanding of SEO, which I apply to my projects.

I hold a Computer Science diploma, but I consider myself a perpetual student, always eager to learn and explore new and valuable things. Watching movies and series is one of my favorite pastimes, and I proudly identify as a gamer.

My goal is to become a successful Front-End Developer, and Iâ€™m committed to expanding my knowledge and skills every day.

_ðŸ”§ Currently working on becoming a "JavaScript Ninja." If you see me with my coffee, you can bet I'm debugging away! â˜•_
